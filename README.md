# PuzzleManor

This game is a 3D point-and-click adventure game, in which the player has to solve a number of riddles and puzzles around the rooms of a strange manor.

Puzzle Manor is my first game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It is a solo project, in which I remake my first ever Unity game, of which only the assets remain. This version also improves and adds a lot from the original.
